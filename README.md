# De-Boors-algorithm
De Boor's algorithm is a method for evaluating B-spline curves. It is implemented here in C++. Python scripts are used as input files to generate a knot vector, x coordinates, y coordinates, and specify the polynomial order.

pybind11 is used as the interface between C++ and Python. I wrote bindings to expose C++ functions to Python.
